            <p>This series was recommended to me by my friend Jacksons dad, shoutout Mr. Perkins. It's a Fantasy series that takes place in two opposing "true" worlds called Amber and Chaos. These true worlds make up the poles of the universe and in between them are thousands of shadow worlds, including Earth. Shadow worlds are spawned by the forces of Amber and Chaos reacting with each other. The books primarily follow Corwin, an immortal prince of Amber who has the ability to walk through these shadow worlds. Characters in this series can alter reality by choosing which elements of shadow to add or subtract.</p>
            
            <p>The series is long and I'm not here to summarize the whole thing but I will seriously vouch for the first five books in the series. When Mr. Perkins explained the series to me, he did it much like I did above. It took me a long time to decide to pick this book up because, although it had a cool premise, it felt sort of old school (no offense Mr. Perkins!). I can now say I was definitely wrong. Zelazny's characters feel really modern and fleshed out. I was constantly changing my opinion on characters the more I read. Zelazny gives himself a lot of worldbuilding freedom by setting up the shadow worlds situation, and he takes good advantage of it.</p>
            
            <p>The reason this book isn't an 8/10 is because latter five books in the series aren't nearly as strong as the first five. I don't know if it's because the protagonist shifts from Corwin to his son Merlin who I found less interesting. Maybe I just got impatient with the story. Maybe The first five were just so good anything following it was doomed to fail. Whatever it was those latter five books are the reason this series gets a 6.6/10.</p>
            
            <p>Two of my favorite quotes from this series:</p>
            
            <blockquote>"I see desire as hidden identity and striving as its growth"</blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>"I had a false identity once. It helped me alot in becoming the absolute that I am now."</blockquote>
