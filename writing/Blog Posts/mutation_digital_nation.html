            <p>The term 'echo chamber' started showing up in online discourse as early as 1997, when John Katz wrote <em>WIRED</em> article, <a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/04/netizen-3/" target="_blank">Birth of a Digital Nation<sup>1</sup></a>. Katz's article, sees the internet as the force that would free people from the limitations of traditional media programming. Talk shows, newspapers, and radios were no longer the only vehicles for news. The net, as Katz calls it, connected thousands of people, and completely transformed the way we're fed information. But the internet not only allowed an unbridled flow of information in, it allowed for an unlimited flow out. Katz "argued with technoanarchists about rules, flamers about civility, white kids about rap, black kids about police, journalists about media, evangelicals about sin." People of all backgrounds could share their two cents no matter how radical, raunchy, or downright disingenuous. Katz saw this virtual liberation as a way to dismantle top-down media gatekeeping and spark political awakening.</p>

            <h3>No dice Mr. Katz.</h3>
            <p>Between the dot-com boom, the chaos of Y2K, and the hype of <em>The Matrix</em>, it's not surprising Katz was excited. The web may have felt revolutionary, and certainly redefined political factions, industries and lives. But this period was short lived. I was born in 2001, and I have never lived in a politically undivided America. Katz's logic makes sense, his article is widely cited, and his evidence is sound. So how did we manage to take something so liberating and become even more informationally siloed?</p>

            <h3>Echo... Echo... Echo... (Chambers)</h3>
            
            <p><em>"An echo chamber is a closed system where other voices are excluded by omission, causing your beliefs to become amplified or reinforced"<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-50850-6" target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a></em></p>
            
            <p>Echo chambers that existed before the internet were mostly products of geography. We couldn't communicate far or fast enough to pop our informational bubbles. Geography was the first version, the algorithm is the sequel. We're in the same boat as before, just stuck in virtual echo chambers instead. We just can't seem to help but organize ourselves into homogenous groups, regardless of the medium.</p>

            <p>The source of online echo chambers is still up for debate. There are people much smarter than me, trying to quantitatively define this behavior. If numbers gets your blood flowing then check out these <a href="https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-019-0213-9" target="_blank">equations<sup>3</sup></a>, <a href="https://www.jasss.org/24/3/1.html" target="_blank">models<sup>4</sup></a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1906.12325" target="_blank">simulations<sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>If numbers give you headaches, I found the theory of "homophily" to be the most compelling anthropologic answer. Homophily is the tendency for people to seek out others similar to them. We naturally prefer to be surrounded by people we share traits with. IRL this manifests itself in the basic structure of our society/communities. It's why NY has a Chinatown, colleges have clubs, and I'm surrounded by incredibly good-looking people ;). This, of course, can have negative ramifications too. Any "-ism" is essentially the inverse of homophily. We just don't like anything that isn't "us". This translates even more poorly when applied to the internet, where interaction can be anonymous and traceless.</p>

            <p>Whatever the catalyst/source, echo chambers are here to stay. A study published by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50850-6" target="_blank">Scientific Reports<sup>5</sup></a> goes so far as to say there is <u>no regulatory solution</u> to the echo chamber effect online.</p>

            <h3>So are we fucked?</h3>
            <p>I think we may be fucked!</p>

            <p>Katz's <em>Birth of a Digital Nation</em> was written during a digital revolution, and I can't help but feel we're on the verge of another 28 years later.</p>

            <p>Part of what prompted me to write this modern, poor man's version of Katz's article was a book I read called <em>Fall; or, Dodge in Hell</em> by Neal Stephenson. Early in the book Stephenson introduces "edit streams", a 24/7 feed of media, news, and content. Every character experiences a distinct stream, crafted by AI based on their emotional state, biometric cues, and beliefs. These streams are a core driver of societal breakdown in the book: if your perception of events is unique to you, communal reality collapses.</p>

            <p>After reading the book in late 2020 I promptly forget almost all of its contents but the idea of edit streams stuck with me. The book was published in 2019 and in the small number of years that have passed since publish, we have made disturbingly rapid progress to making edit streams a reality. Stephenson's words feel eerily prescient.</p>

            <p><em>"I would say that the ability of people to agree on matters of fact not immediately visible—states of affairs removed from them in space and time—ramped up from a baseline of approximately zero to a pretty high level around the time of the scientific revolution and all that, and stayed there and became more globally distributed up through the Cronkite era, and then dropped to zero incredibly quickly when the Internet came along."<sup>1</sup></em></p>

            <p>If you ask me (somebody please ask me -> <a href="mailto:alecohanesian@gmail.com">alecohanesian@gmail.com</a>) it seems humanity is speeding headlong into a complete breakdown of online community, credibility, and communication. But where does that leave us? My current favorite theory is the <a href="https://forum.agoraroad.com/index.php?threads/dead-internet-theory-most-of-the-internet-is-fake.3011/" target="_blank">Dead Internet Theory<sup>7</sup></a>: a semi-fringe conspiracy that claims much of the internet—particularly content and interactions—is increasingly generated by bots, AI, or corporate scripts, rather than real humans. Be warned—this theory comes from a guy who goes by "IlluminatiPirate," and labels himself an <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Oldfag" target="_blank">"oldfag"</a>.</p>

            <p>This garbled word vomit I call a blog post will soon join the other billions of shitposts that serve as the backdrop of the web. I'm sure this was more fun to write than it will be to read and maybe that's the point of the internet. To cast our thoughts into the endless void of cyberspace, hoping to hear something back, even if it's our own echo. Had to really channel my inner Neo/Tyler Durden for that last sentence.</p>
